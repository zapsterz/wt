		<p class="exptext textcolwhite">Waggy Tails is expensive to run - we are grateful for every single donation.</p>

		<p class="exptext textcolwhite">It is a sad but true fact that many young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorders suffer from some form of depression. They are often bullied and can find it difficult to make friends. We would like to be able to help our youngsters by offering professional guidance before they become overwhelmed by the pressures they have to face in every day life.</p>

		<p class="exptext textcolwhite">We use give.net to assist with our donations. A massive thank you from everyone at Waggy Tails!</p>
