			<p class="exptext">The Waggy Tails members are aged from 13-18 years. 

			All of our members have special needs/disabilities, with social and communication difficulties being the common link between them.

			We never set out to distinguish which disabilities Waggy Tails would best suit. It just happened that quite a few of our children at Waggy Tails are on the Autistic Spectrum e.g. Aspergers Syndrome.
